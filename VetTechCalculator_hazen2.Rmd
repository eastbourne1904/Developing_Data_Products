## Veterinarian ranks as fastest growing profession in United States 
![ref](figures/PetOwnershipStats.png)  
<br>
<p>This means the pass-through of patients is increasing annually without an equivalent staff to accommodate.</p>
<p>To keep up, Veterinary Technicians and Assistants are required to know more and do more. 

## Knowledge and Accuracy
<font size="4">
<p>Included in this knowledge is medicine dosages, energy requirements, food requirements, fluid rates, rehydrations, and other equation based calculations.</p>
<p>Some of these calculations are complicated and, **if wrong, could impact a patients health**.</p>
<p>Because of the complexity and importance of these calculations, the **speed and accuracy are key**.</p>
<p>Just some of the calculations and equations used during an exam</p></font>
<font size="3", color="blue">
- Calculating Total Fluid Needs (TFN) in ml/hr and convert into drops/second.  
- Calculate doses in both mgs and mls.  
- Calculate Constant Rate Infusions (CRIâ€™s)  
- Calculate CRI doses  
- Weight Conversions  
- Generic name for Name Brand equivalents  
...just to name a few
</font>

## Keeping up by adding a Shiny App

<font size="3">
<p>In order to keep pace with the growing pass-through of patience, Vet Techs currently rely on:  
- Traditional equations, calculated by hand  
- Apps created on iPad  
- Apps online  

<img src="figures/Courtney1.png" alt="Squirley face" align="right"></p>

<p>The problem with these are:  
- Traditional methods can take too long, or worse, be inaccurate   
- Apps may not port over to all devices, leaving large gaps in availability  
- Apps online are too cumbersome, hard to find, and are too simplistic  
</p></font>

<font size="3">
<p> What if a Shiny App Vet-Tech calculator could be a supplement to current Veterinary software, so every piece of information and every calculation could be entered as data into a patients file?</p>
<p> Using simple exports and imports, an automation engineer could import data from a shiny app calculator into the existing software. Using a csv file or a sql database, any automation engineer worth his salt could make the import/export appear seamless. This would improve accuracy and performance of both Vet-Tech and doctor.</p>

<h1>Give Vet-Tech Calculator a try...</h1><br>
<font size="3"><p>Input the age and weight of your dog, then select a medicine. Vet-Tech Calculator will give you the dosage needed for that medicine. Switch tabs to Calorie Intake.  Vet-Tech Calculator will automtically use the weight and age you already input as part of the calculation.</p></font>
