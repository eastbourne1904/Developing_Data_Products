## Veterinarian ranks as fastest growing profession in United States  
![alt text](figures/PetOwnershipStats.png)  
<br>
<p>This means the pass-through of patients is increasing annually without an equivalent staff to accommodate.</p>
<p>To keep up, Veterinary Technicians and Assistants are required to know more and do more. 

## Knowledge and Accuracy
<font size="4">
<p>Included in this knowledge is medicine dosages, energy requirements, food requirements, fluid rates, rehydrations, and other equation based calculations.</p>
<p>Some of these calculations are complicated and, **if wrong, could impact a patients health**.</p>
<p>Because of the complexity and importance of these calculations, the **speed and accuracy are key**.</p>
<p>Just some of the calculations and equations used during an exam</p></font>
<font size="3", color="blue">
- Calculating Total Fluid Needs (TFN) in ml/hr and convert into drops/second.  
- Calculate doses in both mgs and mls.  
- Calculate Constant Rate Infusions (CRIâ€™s)  
- Calculate CRI doses  
- Weight Conversions  
- Generic name for Name Brand equivalents  
...just to name a few
</font>

## Keeping up
<font size="3">
<p>In order to keep pace with the growing pass-through of patience, Vet Techs currently rely on:</p>
- Traditional equations, calculated by hand  
- Apps created on iPad  
- Apps online  

<p>The problem with these are:</p>
- Traditional methods can take too long, or worse, be inaccurate  
- Apps may not port over to all devices, leaving large gaps in availability
- Apps online are too cumbersome, hard to find, and are too simplistic
</font>

## Shiny App added
<font size="3">
<p> What if a Shiny App Vet-Tech calculator could be a supplement to current Veterinary software, so every piece of information and every calculation could be entered as data into a patients file?</p>
<p> Using simple exports and imports, an automation engineer could import data from a shiny app calculator into the existing software. Using a csv file or a sql database, any automation engineer worth his salt could make the import/export appear seamless. This would improve accuracy and performance of both Vet-Tech and doctor.</p>

This simple calculator holds values of "weight", "medicine", and "age", which can be used for other calculations; so you don't need to re-enter data, and to export to patient chart.
